          <h2>Our Work</h2>
          <h5>Advancing responsible Consumption & <span>Production</span></h5>
          <p>To achieve our goals and aims we work on three different approaches
            <strong>Awareness -</strong> Educate young fashion-forward consumers about the benefits of using Khadi
            and its relevance in todayâ€™s modern generation leading them to the right path of responsible
            consumption in terms of apparel, hence promoting the vision of SDG 12
            <br><strong>Elevation -</strong> To help small Khadi businesses boost their sales and thrive in competence
            to fast fashion brands.
            We partner with youth-oriented fashion designers to offer appealing designs for
            young audiences.
            We partner with fashion influencers to promote khadi, increasing its visibility and
            sales.
            <br><strong>Advocacy -</strong> We advocate for fair policies and initiatives that directly benefit local artisans
            and Khadi businesses leveraging and educating them about the financial resources and
            equipment provided by the Khadi and Village Industry Commission (KVIC).
